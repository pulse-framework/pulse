### PULSE V2 IS OUT

Please read the [changelog](https://pulsejs.org/introduction/changelog.html) to ensure your old code is compatible.

Pulse is a global state and logic framework for reactive Javascript applications. Supporting frameworks like VueJS, React and React Native. Lightweight, modular and powerful, but most importantly friendly to beginngers.

## Why Pulse?

After exploring the many options for Javascript state libraries, including the popular VueX and Redux, I felt like I needed a simpler solution. I wanted to get more out of a library than just state management― something that could provide solid structure for the **entire** application. It needed to be structured and simple, but also scalable. This library provides everything needed to get a reactive javascript front-end application working fast, taking care to follow best practices and to employ simple terminology that makes sense even to beginners.

I built this framework reflective of the architecture in which we use at Notify.me, and as a replacement for VueX at Notify also, making sure it is also compatible with React and vanilla environments. The team at Notify love it and I think you will too.
