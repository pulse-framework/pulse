# Pulse Framework
______________________________________________________________

### NO LONGER MAINTAINED.
Use [AgileTS](https://github.com/agile-ts/agile) which was based on this library.
______________________________________________________________
**Global state and logic for reactive JavaScript applications.** Supports frameworks like React, Vue, and React Native.

**Lightweight, modular and powerful.** Provides a **core** state & logic framework for your entire application; plug-and-play directly into any UI framework.

Replaces Redux, Vuex, and MobX for state; and for API requests, replaces Axios and `fetch`.

## Why Pulse?

Pulse Framework provides a complete toolset to build front-end applications quickly and efficiently. It encourages you to construct a single core library that can be used in any UI framework. The core handles everything at the center of your application â€” state management, API requests, and all miscellaneous logic and calculations. Pulse supplies computed data to your UI components with full reactivity, in the framework of your choice.

### TypeScript

Pulse is fully written in TypeScript and supports it heavily. Everything is type-safe out of the box and encourages you to write clean, typed code.
